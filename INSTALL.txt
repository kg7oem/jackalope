Jackalope uses Boost internally and has a minimum version requirement of
1.66 unless otherwise specified. If a suitable system wide version of
Boost is not found then Boost can be downloaded and built automatically
with -DDOWNLOAD_OK=ON specified as an argument to cmake. If possible
it is recommended to use a system wide Boost library.

Debian

On a Debian based system you'll need the following packages:

  build-essential cmake libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev
  libboost-regex-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-system-dev
  libboost-thread-dev

The following packages enable optional support in Jackalope:

  * DBus: libdbus-1-dev libdbus-c++-dev

  * Jack Audio: libjack-jackd2-dev or libjack-dev

  * Perl: libperl-dev

  * Portaudio: portaudio19-dev

  * RtAudio: librtaudio-dev

  * Sndfile: libsndfile1-dev

Building the software looks like this:

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ cmake --build .
